# SOScrollViewInfinite

Are you too facing the same problem of displaying large amount of data on small screens of iOS devices?

Yes?

First of all, don’t worry because you’re not alone. I, myself had this same problem while I was working on a project at Space-O Technologies. The project app required to display large amount of data which seemed impossible to me at first.

But because of great support from seniors here, I finally learn about UIScrollView and how, with the help of UIScrollView, display these large amount of data efficiently in iOS devices.

Thus, I’ve written an article on the UIScrollView Tutorial to share with you about integrating and implementing it for manage large amount of data on screen.

However, this is just a simple demo, but if you have any idea for iOS app that also needs large amount of data to be handled and displayed efficiently, you can contact Space-O Technologies - An [iPhone app development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/iphone-app-development/) for the same.
